Now let's start a Dockerfile to package up our monolith...

`touch Dockerfile`{{execute}}

Please navigate to the "server" directory in the Editor window and open the Dockerfile.  Then continue...

<pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace">
# We'll put our code here

</pre>

If you did this correctly, you should now see "# We'll put our code here" in the text editor.
