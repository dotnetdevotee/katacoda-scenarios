Let's start building a Dockerfile for the client now!

`cd ..`{{execute}}

`cd client`{{execute}}

`touch Dockerfile`{{execute}}

Please navigate to the "client" directory in the Editor window and open the Dockerfile.  Then continue...

<pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace">
# We'll put our code here

</pre>

If you did this correctly, you should now see "# We'll put our code here" in the text editor.
